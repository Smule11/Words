# Word Visualisation Prototype One

All of the main visualisation's JavaScript and HTML and CSS are in one file. This file is called through the given URL.

https://smule11.github.io/Words.html

There is a separate HTML for references which are linked from the main displays page.

Clicking on nodes, using the drop downs, back and forward buttons and searching for words are the main modes of interaction.

## Objectives

- Explore and visualise words, their connections and meaning. 
- To help in learning more of a language regardless of skill level.

- For tracking word etymologies, histories. 
- For investigating word meanings and semantics for personal use or for research purposes.

## Further Work (Phase 1)

- Add a toggle to expand/zoom/add the current central word's alternative defintion/meaning nodes
  e.g. lternative definitions can be connected by dotted line
- Add a zoom to expand/zoom/add the current central word's synonyms of synonyms,
  e.g. 1x zoom is only immediate synonyms, 2x zoom adds immediate synonyms synonyms, and so on  
- With zoom we can add pan function
- Highlight the currently selected node and emphasise past selected nodes via subtle saturation
- Fish-eye toggle, for when you've zoomed out a lot to emphasise the words around the currently selected word
- Context examples somehow in background, or in tool-tip
- Add ability to toggle-hide the description on the left.
- Title in between tool-bar "back/forward" and "search/refresh" buttons
- Toggle toolbars and part of speech (PoS) bar.
- Filter on PoS, frequency, precision
- After changes recheck mobile use

## Further Work (Phase 2)

- Reformat, recomment, tidy code and so can be manipulated fast and easily by anyone.
- Test more on users and reconsider fundamental redesigns.
- Create more 'Word-Semantic' Visualisation prototypes.
